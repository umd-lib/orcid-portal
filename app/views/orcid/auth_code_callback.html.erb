<p>
  You have successfully registered ORCID ID
  <a href="<%= @orcid_record.orcid_id %>" target="_blank">
    <img src="/ORCID-iD_icon-16x16.png"> <%= @orcid_record.orcid_id %></a>. Thank You!
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Now that you have an ORCID you can start managing your identity! The first
  thing you should do is go to the ORCID website
  (<a href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a>) and fill out your
  profile, describing your employment history, funding record and publishing
  record.
</p>

<p>
  In many cases, when you write a grant, or submit an manuscript for
  publication, linking to your ORCID ID is built into the workflow. You can also
  include it on your website and other creative achievements as you like. It is
  your ID!
